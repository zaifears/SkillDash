# SkillDash — DSE Paper Trading Simulator (Full Documentation)

> SkillDash is the only free, browser-based paper trading platform built specifically for the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). It lets users practice buying and selling real DSE-listed stocks using virtual money (Fake BDT) with live market data, T+1 settlement rules, and brokerage commission charges — enabling anyone to learn stock trading without risking a single taka.

---

## Platform Overview

SkillDash solves a critical gap in the Bangladesh financial education space. While paper trading simulators are widely available for US markets (Investopedia Simulator, Webull Paper Trading, Thinkorswim), **there is no other dedicated paper trading or stock market simulator for the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE)**. Bangladeshi investors — especially beginners — have had virtually no way to practice trading DSE stocks risk-free, leading many to jump into real markets unprepared and lose money.

SkillDash was built to change that. The DSE Stock Market Simulator provides a fully realistic trading experience using live stock price data from the Dhaka Stock Exchange, complete with real trading rules (T+1 settlement, 0.3% commission), real market hours (Sun–Thu, 10 AM – 2:15 PM BST), and real Bangladesh public holiday awareness.

## DSE Stock Market Simulator — Complete Feature Breakdown

### What Is It?
A fully-featured, browser-based stock market simulator that uses real-time data from the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). Users can practice trading stocks without risking real money, experiencing realistic market conditions specific to Bangladesh.

### Real-Time DSE Market Data

**Live Stock Prices:**
- All stock prices are pulled directly from the Dhaka Stock Exchange during market hours
- Prices update in real-time via Firebase Firestore real-time sync
- Data freshness indicator shows users how recent the price data is (e.g., "Updated 2 minutes ago")
- Stale data warnings appear if prices haven't refreshed recently

**Price Information Per Stock:**
- LTP (Last Traded Price) — the most recent price at which a stock was traded
- Price Change — absolute change in BDT from previous close
- Change Percentage — percentage change from previous close
- Color-coded indicators: green for price increases, red for decreases

**Market Status:**
- Automatic detection of whether the DSE market is currently open or closed
- Market hours: 10:00 AM – 2:15 PM Bangladesh Standard Time (BST / UTC+6)
- Trading days: Sunday through Thursday
- Closed on: Fridays, Saturdays, and all Bangladesh national/religious public holidays
- Total number of tradable stocks displayed

### Virtual Trading System

**Starting Capital:**
- Every new user receives **10,000 Fake BDT** (virtual Bangladeshi Taka) upon creating an account
- This is entirely virtual currency — no real money is involved at any point
- Balance is tracked to paisa precision (2 decimal places)

**Buying Stocks:**
- Select any DSE-listed stock from the market view
- Choose the number of shares (quantity must be a positive integer)
- The system calculates: Stock Cost = LTP × Quantity
- A **0.3% brokerage commission** is automatically added to the total cost
- Total deducted from balance = Stock Cost + Commission
- If the user's virtual balance is insufficient, the trade is rejected with a clear error message
- Successful buy orders add the stock to the user's portfolio with the purchase date recorded

**Selling Stocks:**
- Select a stock from the portfolio view
- Choose the number of shares to sell (cannot exceed holdings)
- **T+1 Settlement Rule enforced:** Users CANNOT sell shares on the same day they purchased them. They must wait until the next trading day. This mirrors the real DSE settlement rule.
- Gross proceeds = Current LTP × Quantity
- A **0.3% brokerage commission** is deducted from the proceeds
- Net proceeds = Gross Proceeds − Commission
- Realized gain/loss is calculated: (Sell Price − Average Buy Price) × Quantity − Commission
- Net proceeds are added back to the user's virtual balance

**Transaction Safety:**
- All trades use Firebase Firestore transactions to prevent race conditions
- Precision arithmetic (integer paisa-based) eliminates floating-point errors
- Fresh authentication tokens are verified before every trade
- Balance and portfolio checks happen at transaction-time (not just UI-time) for safety

### Portfolio Management

**Holdings View:**
- List of all stocks the user currently holds
- Per-stock information:
  - Stock symbol and company name
  - Number of shares held
  - Average buy price (weighted average if bought in multiple transactions)
  - Total cost basis
  - Current market value (based on live LTP)
  - Unrealized profit/loss (current value − cost basis)
  - Profit/loss as a percentage
  - Purchase date (used for T+1 rule enforcement)

**Portfolio Summary:**
- Total virtual balance (available cash)
- Total amount invested across all holdings
- Total current portfolio value (sum of all holdings at current market prices)
- Total unrealized gain/loss (paper profit/loss)
- Total realized gain/loss (from all completed sell transactions)
- Overall gain/loss percentage
