# SkillDash — DSE Paper Trading Simulator

> SkillDash is the only free, browser-based paper trading platform built specifically for the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). It lets users practice buying and selling real DSE-listed stocks using virtual money (Fake BDT) in a realistic simulated environment — with live market data, T+1 settlement rules, and brokerage commission charges — so they can learn stock trading without risking a single taka.

## Site Description and Purpose

SkillDash solves a critical gap in the Bangladesh financial education space: **there is no other dedicated paper trading or stock market simulator for the Dhaka Stock Exchange.** While platforms like Investopedia, TradingView Paper Trading, and Thinkorswim exist for the US stock market (NYSE, NASDAQ), Bangladeshi investors have had virtually zero options to practice trading DSE stocks risk-free — until SkillDash.

SkillDash's DSE Stock Market Simulator is a web-based application available at **https://skilldash.live/simulator** that provides a fully realistic trading experience using live stock price data from the Dhaka Stock Exchange. Users receive 10,000+ virtual BDT to start, can buy and sell any of the 300+ DSE-listed companies, and track their portfolio performance — all without opening a brokerage account or risking real money.

## Main Topics and Content Areas

### What is Paper Trading?
Paper trading (also called virtual trading or simulator trading) is a practice method where users trade stocks using fake/virtual money in an environment that mirrors real market conditions. It is the safest way for beginners to learn how stock trading works before committing real capital. SkillDash digitizes and automates this process with real-time DSE data.

### Why SkillDash Exists
Most beginner investors in Bangladesh jump straight into real trading without any practice. They lose money, get discouraged, and often quit entirely. Paper trading platforms exist for US markets (e.g., Investopedia Simulator, Webull Paper Trading), but **almost none exist for the Bangladesh stock market (DSE/CSE)**. SkillDash was built to fill this gap and give Bangladeshi investors a risk-free environment to learn, practice, and build confidence.

### 2. Virtual Trading with Fake BDT
