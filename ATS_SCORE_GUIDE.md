## ATS Score Component Breakdown

### Formatting (0-25 points)
**Checks**:
- Email address present ✓ 5 pts
- LinkedIn/GitHub/Portfolio URL ✓ 5 pts
- Phone number present ✓ 5 pts
- Minimum 15 lines (not empty) ✓ 5 pts
- Clear section headers ✓ 5 pts

**Why it matters**:
- ATS systems parse resume by format
- Missing contact info = recruiter can't reach you
- Poor formatting = misinterpreted content
- Section headers help ATS identify sections

**Quick Fixes** (15-30 min):
```
Add to top of resume:
─────────────────────
[Your Name]
Email: your.email@example.com
Phone: +880-1XXX-XXXXXX
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yourprofile
GitHub: github.com/yourusername (if applicable)

Location: City, Country
```

---

### Keywords & Skills (0-25 points)
**Checks**:
- Technical skills matched (max 10 pts)
- Soft skills matched (max 5 pts)
- Certifications found (max 10 pts)

**Why it matters**:
- Recruiters search for specific skills
- ATS matches keywords to job requirements
- Missing keywords = lower ranking
- Exact terminology matters

**Quick Wins** (1-2 hours):
- Add 5 missing technical skills from your target jobs
- Include all relevant certifications
- Use industry-standard terminology
- Add soft skills where you have evidence

**Example**:

❌ **Wrong**:
```
"Familiar with web development and databases"
```

✓ **Right**:
```
"Technical Skills: Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, 
MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Git, REST APIs"
```

---

### Action Verbs (0-15 points)
**Checks**:
- Count of strong action verbs used
- "Helped" vs "Engineered" vs "Implemented"

**Why it matters**:
- Shows impact vs. passive participation
- ATS recognizes leadership/achievement language
- Better verbs = higher relevance ranking

**Strong Action Verbs** (use these):
```
Technical: Engineered, Developed, Deployed, Debugged, 
           Optimized, Configured, Architected, Coded

Leadership: Led, Directed, Managed, Coordinated, 
            Orchestrated, Championed, Spearheaded

Achievement: Achieved, Attained, Accelerated, Boosted, 
             Delivered, Exceeded, Outperformed

Creation: Built, Created, Designed, Launched, 
          Established, Implemented, Initiated
```

**Weak Action Verbs** (avoid these):
```
❌ Helped with, Worked on, Assisted in, Involved in, 
  Participated in, Some responsibility for, Helped manage
```

**Example Transformation**:

❌ **Weak**:
```
"Helped with Python project and worked on databases"
```

✓ **Strong**:
```
"Engineered Python backend architecture and optimized 
database queries, reducing query time by 40%"
```

---

### Quantification (0-10 points)
**Checks**:
- Numbers and metrics found
- "Increased by X%", "Reduced by Y"
- Project metrics, KPIs

**Why it matters**:
- Proves impact with data
- Shows ability to measure results
- ATS recognizes achievement patterns

**Quantification Patterns**:

❌ **Vague**:
```
"Improved system performance"
"Increased sales significantly"
"Managed several projects"
```

✓ **Quantified**:
```
"Improved system performance by 45% (from 2s to 1.1s response time)"
"Increased sales by 250% in Q3 (from $50K to $175K)"
"Managed 5 concurrent projects with 98% on-time delivery"
```

**Where to add metrics**:
- Experience section: Always add results
- Project section: Include technologies + metrics
- Achievements: Percentage improvements
- Impact: Time saved, money earned, users reached

---

### Section Completeness (0-10 points)
**Required Sections**:
1. Contact Information (5 pts)
2. Professional Summary or Objective (2 pts)
3. Work Experience (2 pts)
4. Education (1 pt)

**Bonus Sections** (add for full score):
5. Skills (2 pts)
6. Projects (2 pts)
7. Certifications (2 pts)
8. Languages (1 pt)

**Why it matters**:
- ATS looks for standard resume sections
- Missing sections = lost points
- Better organized = higher parsing accuracy

**Recommended Order**:
```
1. Header (Name, Contact)
2. Professional Summary (3-4 lines, 30-40 words)
3. Work Experience (3-5 bullet points per job)
4. Education (Degree, GPA if 3.5+, relevant coursework)
5. Technical Skills (categorized by type)
6. Projects (2-3 most relevant with links)
7. Certifications (recent and relevant)
8. Languages (if multilingual)
```

### JD Alignment (0-30 points, if JD provided)
**Checks**:
- Keyword matching with job description
- Requirement coverage
- Critical skill presence

**Scoring**:
- 90-100%: Exceptional fit
- 75-89%: Strong match
- 60-74%: Good match
- 40-59%: Fair match
- <40%: Poor match

**How to Improve JD Alignment**:

1. **Extract Keywords from JD**:
   ```
   Job Description:
   "Looking for Python developer with 5+ years experience
   in Django and PostgreSQL, AWS certified preferred"
   
   Extract: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, 5+ years
   ```

2. **Map to Your Resume**:
   ```
   Your Resume should contain:
   - "5+ years Python development" (not "3 years")
   - "Django" (spell exactly as in JD)
   - "PostgreSQL" (exact terminology)
   - "AWS Certified" (if you have it)
   ```

3. **Use Exact Terminology**:
   ❌ "Database management" → ✓ "PostgreSQL administration"
   ❌ "Cloud services" → ✓ "AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)"
   ❌ "Backend development" → ✓ "Django REST Framework"
